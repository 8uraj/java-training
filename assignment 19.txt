a)if number is 3 the output will be:
second string
third string
b)yes the output is what i predicted i.e second string third string
because outer if contains condition aNumber>=0 and 3 is >=0 so it will enter in this block...
it contains inner if statement which has condition aNumber==0 but 3is not equals to 0 the condition is false it executes else block and print second string
after else block third string is printed
c)
if(aNumber >= 0){
            if(aNumber==0)
                  System.out.println("first string"); //indentations to identify code snippet clearly
            else
                  System.out.println("second string");
            System.out.println("third string");
   }
d) 
if(aNumber >= 0){
            if(aNumber==0){
                System.out.println("first string");
            }
            else{
                System.out.println("second string");
            }
            System.out.println("third string");
        }

1) The most basic control flow statement supported by java programming is the if statement.
2) The switch statement allows for any number of possible execution paths.
3) The do while statement is similar to the while statement , but evaluates its expression at the end of the loop.
4) We can write infite loop using for  statement by leaving 3 conditions of for loop empty. 
     for(; ; ){
            System.out.println("Infinite");
        }

5) We can write infite loop using while statement by giving true in while loop condition.
   while(true)
  {
        System.out.println("Infinite");
  }
